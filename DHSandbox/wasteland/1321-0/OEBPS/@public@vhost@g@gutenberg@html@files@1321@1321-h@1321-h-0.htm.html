<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">  April is the cruellest month, breeding<br/>  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br/>  Memory and desire, stirring<br/>  Dull roots with spring rain.<br/>  Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>  Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br/>  A little life with dried tubers.<br/>  Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br/>  With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br/>  And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,                            10<br/>  And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br/>  Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br/>  And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,<br/>  My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,<br/>  And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br/>  Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br/>  In the mountains, there you feel free.<br/>  I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br/><br/>  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br/>  Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  20<br/>  You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br/>  A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br/>  And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br/>  And the dry stone no sound of water. Only<br/>  There is shadow under this red rock,<br/>  (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),<br/>  And I will show you something different from either<br/>  Your shadow at morning striding behind you<br/>  Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br/>  I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              30<br/>       Frisch weht der Wind<br/>       Der Heimat zu<br/>       Mein Irisch Kind,<br/>       Wo weilest du?<br/>  "You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;<br/>  "They called me the hyacinth girl."<br/>  —Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,<br/>  Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not<br/>  Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br/>  Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    40<br/>  Looking into the heart of light, the silence.<br/>  Od' und leer das Meer.<br/><br/>  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br/>  Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br/>  Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br/>  With a wicked pack of cards.

Look!)<br/>  Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,<br/>  The lady of situations.                                                 50<br/>  Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,<br/>  And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,<br/>  Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,<br/>  Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<br/>  The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.<br/>  I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.<br/>  Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br/>  Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:<br/>  One must be so careful these days.<br/><br/>  Unreal City,                                                            60<br/>  Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br/>  A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br/>  I had not thought death had undone so many.<br/>  Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br/>  And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.<br/>  Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,<br/>  To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br/>  With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.<br/>  There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying "Stetson!<br/>  "You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!                            70<br/>  "That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br/>  "Has it begun to sprout?

<h2 id="pgepubid00006">NOTES ON "THE WASTE LAND"</h2>
<p>Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend: From Ritual to Romance (Macmillan).&lt;1&gt; Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.</p>

The Phoenician Sailor<br/>  and the Merchant appear later; also the "crowds of people," and<br/>  Death by Water is executed in Part IV.  The Man with Three Staves<br/>  (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily,<br/>  with the Fisher King himself.<br/><br/>  60.  Cf.  Baudelaire:<br/><br/>       "Fourmillante cite;, cite; pleine de reves,<br/>       Ou le spectre en plein jour raccroche le passant."<br/><br/>  63.  Cf.  Inferno, iii.  55-7.<br/><br/>                                     "si lunga tratta<br/>       di gente, ch'io non avrei mai creduto<br/>       che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta."<br/><br/>  64.  Cf.  Inferno, iv.  25-7:<br/><br/>       "Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,<br/>       "non avea pianto, ma' che di sospiri,<br/>       "che l'aura eterna facevan tremare."<br/><br/>  68.  A phenomenon which I have often noticed.<br/><br/>  74.  Cf.  the Dirge in Webster's White Devil .<br/><br/>  76.  V.

Verlaine, Parsifal.<br/><br/>  210.  The currants were quoted at a price "carriage and insurance<br/>  free to London"; and the Bill of Lading etc. were to be handed<br/>  to the buyer upon payment of the sight draft.<br/><br/>  Notes 196 and 197 were transposed in this and the Hogarth Press edition,<br/>  but have been corrected here.<br/><br/>  210.  "Carriage and insurance free"] "cost, insurance and freight"-Editor.<br/><br/>  218.  Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a "character,"<br/>  is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest.<br/>  Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into<br/>  the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct<br/>  from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman,<br/>  and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.  What Tiresias sees, in fact,<br/>  is the substance of the poem.  The whole passage from Ovid is<br/>  of great anthropological interest:<br/><br/>       '. . . Cum Iunone iocos et maior vestra profecto est<br/>       Quam, quae contingit maribus,' dixisse, 'voluptas.'<br/>       Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti<br/>       Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota.<br/>       Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva<br/>       Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu<br/>       Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem<br/>       Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem<br/>       Vidit et 'est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,'<br/>       Dixit 'ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet,<br/>       Nunc quoque vos feriam!' percussis anguibus isdem<br/>       Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago.<br/>       Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa<br/>       Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto<br/>       Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique<br/>       Iudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte,<br/>       At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam<br/>       Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto<br/>       Scire futura dedit poenamque levavit honore.<br/><br/>  221.  This may not appear as exact as Sappho's lines, but I had in mind<br/>  the "longshore" or "dory" fisherman, who returns at nightfall.<br/><br/>  253.  V. Goldsmith, the song in The Vicar of Wakefield.<br/><br/>  257.  V.  The Tempest, as above.<br/><br/>  264.  The interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of<br/>  the finest among Wren's interiors.  See The Proposed Demolition<br/>  of Nineteen City Churches (P. S. King &amp; Son, Ltd.).<br/><br/>  266.  The Song of the (three) Thames-daughters begins here.<br/>  From line 292 to 306 inclusive they speak in turn.<br/>  V.  Götterdämmerung, III.  i:  the Rhine-daughters.<br/><br/>  279.  V. Froude, Elizabeth, Vol.  I, ch.  iv, letter of De Quadra<br/>  to Philip of Spain:<br/><br/>  "In the afternoon we were in a barge, watching the games on the river.<br/>  (The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the poop,<br/>  when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord Robert<br/>  at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why they<br/>  should not be married if the queen pleased."<br/><br/>  293.  Cf.  Purgatorio, v.  133:<br/><br/>       "Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;<br/>       Siena mi fe', disfecemi Maremma."<br/><br/>  307.  V. St. Augustine's Confessions:  "to Carthage then I came,<br/>  where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears."<br/><br/>  308.  The complete text of the Buddha's Fire Sermon (which corresponds<br/>  in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which these words are taken,<br/>  will be found translated in the late Henry Clarke Warren's Buddhism<br/>  in Translation (Harvard Oriental Series). Mr. Warren was one<br/>  of the great pioneers of Buddhist studies in the Occident.<br/><br/>  309.  From St. Augustine's Confessions again.  The collocation<br/>  of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism,<br/>  as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.<br/><br/>  V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID<br/><br/>  In the first part of Part V three themes are employed:<br/>  the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous<br/>  (see Miss Weston's book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.<br/><br/>  357.  This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, the hermit-thrush<br/>  which I have heard in Quebec County.  Chapman says (Handbook of<br/>  Birds of Eastern North America) "it is most at home in secluded<br/>  woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not remarkable<br/>  for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and<br/>  exquisite modulation they are unequalled."  Its "water-dripping song"<br/>  is justly celebrated.<br/><br/>  360.  The following lines were stimulated by the account of one<br/>  of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one<br/>  of Shackleton's): it was related that the party of explorers,<br/>  at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion<br/>  that there was one more member than could actually be counted.<br/><br/>  367-77. Cf.  Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:<br/><br/>  "Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem<br/>  Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang<br/>  und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang.<br/>  Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt, der Heilige<br/>  und Seher hört sie mit Tränen."<br/><br/>  402.  "Datta, dayadhvam, damyata" (Give, sympathize,<br/>  control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found<br/>  in the Brihadaranyaka-Upanishad, 5, 1.  A translation is found<br/>  in Deussen's Sechzig Upanishads des Veda, p.  489.<br/><br/>  408.  Cf.  Webster, The White Devil, v.  vi:<br/><br/>                                                      ". . . they'll remarry<br/>     Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider<br/>     Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs."<br/><br/>  412.  Cf.  Inferno, xxxiii.  46:<br/><br/>            "ed io sentii chiavar l'uscio di sotto<br/>            all'orribile torre."<br/><br/>  Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p.  346:<br/><br/>  "My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my<br/>  thoughts or my feelings.  In either case my experience falls within<br/>  my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its<br/>  elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround<br/>  it. . . . In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul,<br/>  the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul."<br/><br/>  425.  V. Weston, From Ritual to Romance; chapter on the Fisher King.<br/><br/>  428.  V.  Purgatorio, xxvi.  148.<br/><br/>            "'Ara vos prec per aquella valor<br/>             'que vos guida al som de l'escalina,<br/>             'sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.'<br/>              Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina."<br/><br/>  429.  V.  Pervigilium Veneris.  Cf.  Philomela in Parts II and III.<br/><br/>  430.  V. Gerard de Nerval, Sonnet El Desdichado.<br/><br/>  432.  V. Kyd's Spanish Tragedy.<br/><br/>  434.  Shantih.  Repeated as here, a formal ending to an Upanishad.<br/>  'The Peace which passeth understanding' is a feeble translation<br/>  of the content of this word.<br/></div>
